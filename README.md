# HRE Can Hold Rome
EU4 Mod to let the HRE hold Rome without the occupation of Rome penalty.

Note: this does not remove the event to create the Papal States from Rome. It makes perfect sense for the Catholic world to be mad that the Pope is not an independent state, and for the stability hit that comes from it. All this removes is the penalty for holding rome, which as the Holy **Roman** Empire Paradox should have never allowed in the first place. But thats Paradox QA for you I suppose.
